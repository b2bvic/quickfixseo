# Client Audit System - Ready to Use! 🚀

Your Screaming Frog client audit system is now fully installed and ready to use.

## ✅ What's Been Set Up

1. **Screaming Frog Command-Line Alias**: `screamingfrog` command is now available in your terminal
2. **Directory Structure**: 
   - `~/Documents/Client_Audits/` - Main folder for all client results
   - `~/Documents/SF-Configs/` - For storing configuration files
3. **Two Ready-to-Use Scripts**:
   - `run_client_audits.sh` - Bulk audit multiple clients
   - `single_client_audit.sh` - Quick single client audit

## 🎯 How to Use

### Option 1: Single Client Audit (Quickest)
```bash
./single_client_audit.sh https://client-website.com
```

### Option 2: Multiple Client Audits
1. Edit `run_client_audits.sh`
2. Replace the example URLs with your actual client websites
3. Run: `./run_client_audits.sh`

## 📁 Folder Structure Created

Each audit creates this structure:
```
~/Documents/Client_Audits/
├── client1_com/
│   ├── 2025-06-06/          # Today's crawl
│   ├── 2025-06-07/          # Tomorrow's crawl
│   └── ...
├── client2_com/
│   ├── 2025-06-06/
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

Each dated folder contains:
- All CSV exports (internal_all.csv, etc.)
- Saved crawl file (.seospider)
- crawl_info.txt summary

## 🛠️ Quick Test

Test your setup right now:
```bash
./single_client_audit.sh https://example.com
```

This will create a test audit to make sure everything works!

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Test the system** with the command above
2. **Add your real client URLs** to `run_client_audits.sh`
3. **Create custom configurations** in Screaming Frog app and save to `~/Documents/SF-Configs/`
4. **Run your first real audits**!

## 💡 Pro Tips

- Each subsequent crawl of the same client gets its own dated folder
- Use custom configurations for different audit types (e-commerce, SaaS, etc.)
- All exports are automatically saved as CSV files
- The .seospider file can be opened in Screaming Frog app for further analysis
